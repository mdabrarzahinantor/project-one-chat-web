## Frontend:

### 🔖 ReactJS

>A JavaScript library for building user interfaces.React makes it painless to create interactive UIs. Design simple views for each state in your application, and React will efficiently update and render just the right components when your data changes.Declarative views make your code more predictable and easier to debug.Build encapsulated          components that manage their own state, then compose them to make complex UIs.Since component logic is written in JavaScript instead of templates, you can easily pass rich     data through your app and keep state out of the DOM.We don’t make assumptions about the rest of your technology stack, so you can develop new features in React without         rewriting existing code.React can also render on the server using Node and power mobile apps using React Native.
  
### 🔖 React Router

>REACT ROUTER,Components are the heart of React's powerful, declarative programming model. React Router is a collection of navigational components that compose declaratively     with your application. Whether you want to have bookmarkable URLs for your web app or a composable way to navigate in React Native, React Router works wherever React is      rendering--so take your pick!
    

## Backend:

### 🔥 Firebase

### 🔥 Firestore

>Cloud Firestore is a NoSQL document database that lets you easily store, sync, and query data for your mobile and web apps - at global scale.

### 🔥 Storage

>Firebase Storage is an object storage service you can access via Google Cloud Platform. When using Google Firebase Storage, you can access files through references, easily upload files, and also monitor progress with tasks.

### 🔥 Authentication

>Firebase Authentication provides backend services, easy-to-use SDKs, and ready-made UI libraries to authenticate users to your app. It supports authentication using passwords, phone numbers, popular federated identity providers like Google, Facebook and Twitter, and more.

### 🔥 Firebase Security Rules

>Firebase Security Rules work by matching a pattern against database paths, and then applying custom conditions to allow access to data at those paths. All Rules across Firebase products have a path-matching component and a conditional statement allowing read or write access.
